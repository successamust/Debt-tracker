# Debt Tracker API

[![Deploy on Render](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deployed%20on-Render-4d7fff?logo=render&logoColor=white)](https://debt-tracker-api-2ojf.onrender.com)

A simple and powerful API that reads debt records from a **Google Sheet** and exposes them via REST endpoints. Perfect for managing IOUs, shared expenses, and debt splits among friends or teams.

## How It Works

This project fetches data from a **public Google Sheet**, where:

- **Rows** represent **debtors**
- **Columns** represent **creditors**
- **Cells** contain the amount owed

It transforms the sheet into structured debt records like:

```json
{
  "debtor": "Mojito",
  "creditor": "Ashley",
  "amount": 4.3
}
````
